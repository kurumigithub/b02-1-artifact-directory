Title:
Rethinking Creditworthiness

Abstract:
The process of capturing what makes a creditor trustworthy or not is especially vital within the confines of bank data, due to the guidelines and ethics of what makes this data usable. Although the quantity of the data is massive, there are only a few available features that are explicitly useful in the confines of machine learning, which calls into question how we should measure customer's trustworthiness towards their creditors. Our methodology details the process of refining bank data into categories using Natural Language Processing, assessing individual's income based on bank data alone, and also measuring their credit worthiness both accurately and efficiently.
